What are you doing today?

How confident are you about our goals for the sprint?

--------------------------------------------------------
Starting Notes:
--------------------------------------------------------
The conclusion and goals from the last meeting were to keep researching how to use nodeJS to transfer the capabilities and function
our last project onto a website.

--------------------------------------------------------
Lucas
--------------------------------------------------------
After the last meeting Lucas was not able to complete as much of the tasks as he wanted to because of exams and other classes.

He was able to research how some websites used different extensions and API's to deploy websites and make them functional.

Lucas will continue in doing research for the front end and try to make it accurate to the designed GUI.
--------------------------------------------------------
Nitesh
--------------------------------------------------------
Nitesh was also not able to make as much progress as he would have liked because he also had exams that he needed to prepare for.

Nitesh was still able to get some of the functions of the last project to be functional on the website.

He was able to make some progress in what he was assigned to do and will continue that progress for the first sprint.

His goal is to transfer more of the functions from the last project to the website.
--------------------------------------------------------
Tyler 
--------------------------------------------------------
Tyler has been working on how to style the website to look accurate to the GUI that we designed.

He has accomplished a few of the functions that he was tasked to him and is making steady progress.

Tyler is going to be working on the tasks that he was assigned and try to get them done by the first sprint.

Ending Notes;
--------------------------------------------------------
After ending this meeting the team was able to have some more direction in how the project will be completed after some independent
research done by each team member. The team was in agreement that we are still behind progress and will need to make up for it in the future.
