-------------------------------------------------------- 
Agenda:
-------------------------------------------------------- 

Is there anything preventing contributors from getting work done? 

What did you do yesterday?

What are you doing today?

How confident are you about our goals for the sprint?

 
--------------------------------------------------------
Lucas
--------------------------------------------------------
Lucas went first. He discussed about his status on the project and if we complete the sprint on time.

Yesterday, he completed the google translate api and added it to the customer and the menu side.

Today, he completed designing the menu board with Nitesh and realized we may not be able to complete the customer history due to time constraints.

Lucas believes that the team can provide a successful end product for our Project 3.
--------------------------------------------------------
Tyler 
--------------------------------------------------------
Tyler went next. He discussed his status on the project and designed the template for the customer history.

He fixed the bugs on the manager view with the manager reports and editing items.

Today he worked with the Lucas on getting the google translate api onto the website.

Tyler also believes that the team can submit a product that is satisfactory.
--------------------------------------------------------
Nitesh
--------------------------------------------------------
Nitesh went last. He also presented his status update on the project and discussed if we should leave out the customer history due to lack of time.

Yesterday, he worked with Lucas to get the menu board completed and styled the front end for the customer side to look neat.

Today he worked with Lucas and adjusted the front end for the menu view as well.

Nitesh is confident that we could present a successful team project even if we left out few tasks from the backlog.

Ending Notes;
--------------------------------------------------------
Overall the team was able to catch up to the enormous product backlog we had for Sprint 3 and still created a satisfactory end result
despite having to adjust the original backlog slightly.
